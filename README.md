Basic implementation of the webapp linking to specific annotation projects.

Url (requires UKP vpn connection for now): http://130.83.167.148:5000/

The app allows you to create an own account and add specific annotation tasks. 


1. Adding a new account:

- Go on http://130.83.167.148:5000/register 
- Add username and password (private)
- Add your name, address, and email (will be displayed in the informed consent form)

2. Creating a new annotation task:

- After you login using your credentials go on 'Create Task'
- You are now asked to enter some basic information about the collected data.
- You can include additional checkboxes such as a timestamp on top of the page ('Add Data Type')
- Most of the textfields are pre-filled, but also required. Only the questionnaire is optional.

3. To participate in a study (no login required) go on 'Select Study'

- Select a task. You will be then guided throughout the informed consent form. 
- The link to the study will be provided at the end ('Start the Annotation Task' button)
